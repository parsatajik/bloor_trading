# Market Data Processor

The code here will be used to instantiate the correct market data processor for the given exchange.

## Requirements

- Data Ingestion: Implement efficient mechanisms to connect to various crypto exchange APIs for real-time data feeds. We might need to use WebSockets for real-time data streams.

- Data Normalization: Since we'll be dealing with multiple sources, standardizing the data format for internal use is crucial.

- Data Storage: For real-time processing, we'll likely keep a significant amount of data in memory. However, for historical data analysis and backtesting, we'll need persistent storage.


## Data Storage Solutions

Given the high velocity and volume of data in HFT, choosing the right storage solution is critical. Using cloud-based providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure can offer scalability, reliability, and managed services that reduce the overhead of managing infrastructure.

- In-Memory Databases (such as Redis or Memcached) can be used for real-time data processing and temporary data storage, given their low latency and high throughput.

- Time Series Databases (like InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) are optimized for storing and querying time-series data, ideal for market data and financial time series.

- Cloud Storage Solutions for historical data can be cost-effective and scalable. Options like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage offer high durability for long-term data storage.
